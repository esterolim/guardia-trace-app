**Guardian Trace** empowers users to safely record incidents of stalking or online harassment with military-grade encryption, stealth capabilities, and emergency SOS features. All evidence is protected, encrypted at rest, and designed for legal use.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🛡️ Security-First Design
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all sensitive data
- **SQLCipher Database**: Encrypted database with 100k PBKDF2 iterations
- **AndroidKeyStore Integration**: Hardware-backed key storage
- **Secure Credential Management**: PIN + Biometric authentication
- **Memory Zeroing**: Automatic clearing of sensitive data from memory
- **FLAG_SECURE**: Prevents screenshots and screen recording in production

### 📱 Emergency Capture
- Quick-tap emergency capture of screenshots, photos, or video
- One-touch SOS with emergency contact alerts
- Automatic location logging with timestamps
- Background event monitoring (with user consent)

### 👻 Stealth Mode
- Disguised app icon and appearance
- Hidden notification handling
- Configurable stealth behaviors
- Private file storage with encryption

### 💾 Evidence Management
- Organize incidents by type (harassment, stalking, threat)
- Add attachments (photos, videos, audio, documents)
- Automatic metadata preservation
- Secure file export with integrity verification

### 🔐 Privacy & Compliance
- NO cloud data collection without user consent
- Local-first architecture
- GDPR & privacy regulation compliant
- Data extraction rules configured
- Tamper detection & integrity checking

## 📋 Architecture

Guardian Trace follows **Clean Architecture** with **MVVM** pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer (Jetpack Compose)    │
│  ├─ UI Screens (Auth, Home, Incident, Export)  │
│  ├─ ViewModels with StateFlow                   │
│  └─ Navigation & Routing                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Domain Layer (Business Logic)           │
│  ├─ Use Cases                                   │
│  ├─ Repository Interfaces                       │
│  └─ Domain Models                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Data Layer (Storage & APIs)           │
│  ├─ Room Database (SQLCipher encrypted)         │
│  ├─ Repositories Implementation                 │
│  ├─ Encryption Manager (AES-256-GCM)            │
│  ├─ Security Utilities                          │
│  └─ Local Data Sources                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin 2.0.21
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **DI**: Hilt (Dagger 2)
- **Database**: Room 2.6.1 + SQLCipher 4.5.4
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (AndroidKeyStore) + PBKDF2
- **Async**: Kotlin Coroutines + Flow
- **Compilation**: KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 36 (Target API)
- Minimum API Level 26

### Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GuardianTrace.git
cd GuardianTrace

# Build project
./gradlew build

# Run on device/emulator
./gradlew installDebug
```

### First Launch
1. Set a 4-8 digit PIN for authentication
2. (Optional) Enable biometric authentication
3. Grant required permissions:
   - Camera (for evidence capture)
   - Microphone (for audio recording)
   - Location (for incident tracking)
   - Contacts (for emergency contacts)

## 🔐 Security Baseline

### Encryption Standards
- **Database**: SQLCipher with AES encryption + PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)
- **In-Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum (via network security config)
- **At-Rest**: AES-256-GCM for all sensitive files
- **Keys**: Hardware-backed AndroidKeyStore (API 26+)

### Authentication
- PIN-based access control (PBKDF2-SHA256)
- Biometric authentication (Fingerprint/Face)
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Automatic session management

### Runtime Protection
- **Debugger Detection**: Prevents analysis on rooted devices
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Runtime integrity checks
- **Certificate Pinning**: Network security policy configured
- **Memory Clearing**: Sensitive data zeroed after use
- **Frida Detection**: Anti-tampering measures
